# Directions for installing Bundler and Jekyll
# (as taken from https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)
#
# 1.  Install Ruby.  If you're on a Mac, this should already be done.
#
# 2.  Install the bundler gem:
#     gem install bundler
#
# 3.  Use bundler to install the project's dependencies:
#     bundle install
#
# 4.  To mimic GitHub Pages build server, run Jekyll like this:
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# 5. Then, open http://localhost:4000.
#

source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages'
